//quicksort method
//takes one node pointer and recursively sorts in acending order, returning the head node
struct mynode* quicksort(struct mynode *head)
{
    /*
    I'm pretty sure we need a case where only one node is being passed
    if(head->next == NULL)
    {
        return head;
    }   
    hopefully this will fix something, I have no way of compiling any of this so let me know
	
    I compiled and ran with the above code and it froze my computer, so something weird is 
    going on. -Derek
	
    Also I think the below code would create a node with no value in it, and then later pass
    a list with a dummy node in it. Maybe create the node first in l_current, add a value in
    it, and then later ignore the first node in Left. Hopefully that make sense.
    good luck,
